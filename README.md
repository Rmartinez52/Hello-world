# Hello-world
23/24 Code Louisville pre work project
My name is Rodrigo Martinez, I'm currently a student for code louisville. I worked manufacturing for 6 years. 
I'm looking for a career change now and I believe code Louisville is a great place to start. 
What I'm looking to get out of this class is to have a better understanding of what path I should take and get the most of what I can out of it. 
The quiz I took said "data analysis" but I'm leaning more torwards "software development".
